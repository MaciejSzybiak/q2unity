#### Important note
For many reasons this project is no longer developed and because of that I'd rather not answer any questions
about the following source code.

#### Movement support
The project provides a fully functional Quake II movement in Unity (while using BSP maps).
The entire movement code is based on original id Software's sources and (apparently) works exactly the same
as the original.

#### Game file support
The game has a partial (most features are working) support of Q2 BSP map files including textures, lightmaps
and collision detection. Some entities were implemented by me (for "Jump Mod" purposes).

Additionally .pak files can also be opened (automatically) in order to load original Quake II files.
